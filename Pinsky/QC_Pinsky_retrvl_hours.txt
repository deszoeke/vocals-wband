QC Pinsky retrieval visually by hours

These problems are from missing Kongsberg data and interpolating across
periods of missing Kongsberg data.

Doppler Velocity shifts AND Suspect sea motion contamination (interpolation problem!)

Z and V values stuck, constant, bad

Reflectivity missing

Isolated negative DV not correlated to Z --probably microphysical

324 04

fallstreaks not corrected adequately
329 05

interesting case of upward W at base of virga
335 08

strong rain cell, Vg' important for a change
335 11

NOTES
If reflectivity is very weak, then too few V observations will result in missing lookup table. In this case though Vg is negligible and no correction is really required.

Am I excluding times of known motion correction off/failure? No, and somehow they mostly look OK in the retrieval.

Am I excluding Vg>0 from the retrieval? Yes. Looked-up Vg can be positive, but algorithm only subtracts negative values from V.

Missing data in Kongsberg was the problem of the bad velocities and sea motion contamination.
I have stopped interpolating across missing data (a bug). Second, I am backfilling Kongsberg platform velocities with Crossbow platform velocities integrated from accelerations with an empirical coefficient.

How does the profile of mixing change over warm/cold eddies? Can we say?
